## Request Parameters<a name="API_CreateServer_RequestParameters"></a>

For information about the parameters that are common to all actions, see [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md)\.

The request accepts the following data in JSON format\.

 ** [Certificate](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-Certificate"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) certificate\. Required when `Protocols` is set to `FTPS`\.  
To request a new public certificate, see [Request a public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) in the * AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.  
To import an existing certificate into ACM, see [Importing certificates into ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html) in the * AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.  
To request a private certificate to use FTPS through private IP addresses, see [Request a private certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-private.html) in the * AWS Certificate Manager User Guide*\.  
Certificates with the following cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are supported:  
+ 2048\-bit RSA \(RSA\_2048\)
+ 4096\-bit RSA \(RSA\_4096\)
+ Elliptic Prime Curve 256 bit \(EC\_prime256v1\)
+ Elliptic Prime Curve 384 bit \(EC\_secp384r1\)
+ Elliptic Prime Curve 521 bit \(EC\_secp521r1\)
The certificate must be a valid SSL/TLS X\.509 version 3 certificate with FQDN or IP address specified and information about the issuer\.
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 1600\.  
Required: No

 ** [Domain](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-Domain"></a>
The domain of the storage system that is used for file transfers\. There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\)\. The default value is S3\.  
After the server is created, the domain cannot be changed\.
Type: String  
Valid Values:` S3 | EFS`   
Required: No

 ** [EndpointDetails](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-EndpointDetails"></a>
The virtual private cloud \(VPC\) endpoint settings that are configured for your server\. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet\. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint\.  
Type: [EndpointDetails](API_EndpointDetails.md) object  
Required: No

 ** [EndpointType](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-EndpointType"></a>
The type of endpoint that you want your server to use\. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible \(PUBLIC\) or host it inside your VPC\. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it\.  
 After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your AWS account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021\. If you have already created servers with `EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT` in your AWS account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected\. After this date, use `EndpointType`=`VPC`\.  
For more information, see [Discontinuing the use of VPC\_ENDPOINTYou can change the endpoint type for your server using the Transfer Family console, AWS CLI, API, SDKs, or AWS CloudFormation\. To change your serverâ€™s endpoint type, see [Updating the AWS Transfer Family server endpoint type from VPC\_ENDPOINT to VPC](update-endpoint-type-vpc.md)\.](create-server-in-vpc.md#deprecate-vpc-endpoint)\.  
It is recommended that you use `VPC` as the `EndpointType`\. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses \(BYO IP included\) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address\. This is not possible with `EndpointType` set to `VPC_ENDPOINT`\.
Type: String  
Valid Values:` PUBLIC | VPC | VPC_ENDPOINT`   
Required: No

 ** [HostKey](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-HostKey"></a>
The RSA, ECDSA, or ED25519 private key to use for your SFTP\-enabled server\. You can add multiple host keys, in case you want to rotate keys, or have a set of active keys that use different algorithms\.  
Use the following command to generate an RSA 2048 bit key with no passphrase:  
 `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`\.  
Use a minimum value of 2048 for the `-b` option\. You can create a stronger key by using 3072 or 4096\.  
Use the following command to generate an ECDSA 256 bit key with no passphrase:  
 `ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -N "" -m PEM -f my-new-server-key`\.  
Valid values for the `-b` option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521\.  
Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:  
 `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key`\.  
For all of these commands, you can replace *my\-new\-server\-key* with a string of your choice\.  
If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP\-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key\. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive\.
For more information, see [Update host keys for your SFTP\-enabled server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/edit-server-config.html#configuring-servers-change-host-key) in the * AWS Transfer Family User Guide*\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 4096\.  
Required: No

 ** [IdentityProviderDetails](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-IdentityProviderDetails"></a>
Required when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or `API_GATEWAY`\. Accepts an array containing all of the information required to use a directory in `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` or invoke a customer\-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL\. Not required when `IdentityProviderType` is set to `SERVICE_MANAGED`\.  
Type: [IdentityProviderDetails](API_IdentityProviderDetails.md) object  
Required: No

 ** [IdentityProviderType](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-IdentityProviderType"></a>
The mode of authentication for a server\. The default value is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the AWS Transfer Family service\.  
Use `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE` to provide access to Active Directory groups in AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on\-premises environment or in AWS using AD Connector\. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter\.  
Use the `API_GATEWAY` value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing\. The `API_GATEWAY` setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the `IdentityProviderDetails` parameter\.  
Use the `AWS_LAMBDA` value to directly use an AWS Lambda function as your identity provider\. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the `Function` parameter or the `IdentityProviderDetails` data type\.  
Type: String  
Valid Values:` SERVICE_MANAGED | API_GATEWAY | AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE | AWS_LAMBDA`   
Required: No

 ** [LoggingRole](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-LoggingRole"></a>

Pattern: `[\x09-\x0D\x20-\x7E]*`   
Required: No

 ** [PreAuthenticationLoginBanner](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-PreAuthenticationLoginBanner"></a>
Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server\. This string is displayed before the user authenticates\. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system:  
 `This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.`   
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 512\.  
Pattern: `[\x09-\x0D\x20-\x7E]*`   
Required: No

 ** [ProtocolDetails](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-ProtocolDetails"></a>
The protocol settings that are configured for your server\.  
+  To indicate passive mode \(for FTP and FTPS protocols\), use the `PassiveIp` parameter\. Enter a single dotted\-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer\. 
+ To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the `SETSTAT` command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the `SetStatOption` parameter\. To have the AWS Transfer Family server ignore the `SETSTAT` command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to `ENABLE_NO_OP`\. If you set the `SetStatOption` parameter to `ENABLE_NO_OP`, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a `SETSTAT` call\.
+ To determine whether your AWS Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the `TlsSessionResumptionMode` parameter\.
+  `As2Transports` indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages\. Currently, only HTTP is supported\.
Type: [ProtocolDetails](API_ProtocolDetails.md) object  
Required: No

 ** [Protocols](#API_CreateServer_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="TransferFamily-CreateServer-request-Protocols"></a>
Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint\. The available protocols are:

+  `FTPS` \(File Transfer Protocol Secure\): File transfer with TLS encryption
+  `FTP` \(File Transfer Protocol\): Unencrypted file transfer
+  `AS2` \(Applicability Statement 2\): used for transporting structured business\-to\-business data
+ If you select `FTPS`, you must choose a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS\.
+ If `Protocol` includes either `FTP` or `FTPS`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC` and the `IdentityProviderType` must be either `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`\.
+ If `Protocol` includes `FTP`, then `AddressAllocationIds` cannot be associated\.
+ If `Protocol` is set only to `SFTP`, the `EndpointType` can be set to `PUBLIC` and the `IdentityProviderType` can be set any of the supported identity types: `SERVICE_MANAGED`, `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, or `API_GATEWAY`\.
+ If `Protocol` includes `AS2`, then the `EndpointType` must be `VPC`, and domain must be Amazon S3\.
