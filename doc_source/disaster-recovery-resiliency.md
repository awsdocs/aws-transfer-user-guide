# Resilience in AWS Transfer Family<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\.

 AWS Transfer Family supports up to 3 Availability Zones and is backed by an auto scaling, redundant fleet for your connection and transfer requests\. For an example on how to build for higher redundancy and minimize network latency by using Latency\-based routing, see [Minimize network latency with your AWS Transfer for SFTP servers](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/minimize-network-latency-with-your-aws-transfer-for-sftp-servers/)\.
