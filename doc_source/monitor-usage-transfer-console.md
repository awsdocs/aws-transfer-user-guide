 You can get information about your server's metrics on its **Server details** page\. This provides you with a single place to monitor your file\-transfers workloads\. You can track how many files you have exchanged with your partners and closely track their usage using a centralized dashboard\. For details, see [View server details](configuring-servers-view-info.md)\. The following table describes the metrics available for Transfer Family\.
