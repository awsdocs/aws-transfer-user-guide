# Sign up for AWS<a name="requirements-aws-signup"></a>

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including AWS Transfer Family\. You are charged only for the services that you use\.

If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task\. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root)\.

For information about pricing and to use AWS Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of the cost to use Transfer Family, see [AWS Transfer Family pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sftp/pricing/)\.

For information about AWS Region availability, see the [AWS Transfer Family endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/transfer-service.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
